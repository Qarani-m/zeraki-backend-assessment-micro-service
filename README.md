# zeraki-backend-assessment-micro-service (I will graddually be building this, ie. i will over-engineer)

Here are the reason i put into consideration in deciding which to create first, monolithic or microservice

1: Development timeline : A monolithic app was far much faster to create, test, dockerize and deploy

2: Budget: Most on-budget deployment sites only allow docker files but not docker-compose files



# Why Consider Me?

Here are some reasons why you should consider me for your project:

1. **Advanced Java Spring Boot Knowledge:** With close to 1 year of experience in Spring Boot development, I possess advanced-level knowledge in building robust and scalable Java applications using the Spring Boot framework.

2. **Proficient in Git and GitHub:** I have advanced-level skills in Git and GitHub, including conflict resolution, pull requests, and GitHub Actions. I understand the importance of version control and collaboration in modern software development workflows.

3. **Intermediate Docker and Docker Compose Skills:** I have intermediate-level knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose. I can containerize applications effectively, manage containerized environments, and orchestrate multi-container applications using Docker Compose.

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Experience:** While I have beginner-level knowledge in Jenkins, I possess intermediate-level knowledge in GitHub Actions. I can set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines to automate software delivery processes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.
   
5. **Microservice Architecture Expertise:** I am well-versed in microservice architecture, including event-driven microservice architecture using RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka. I understand the principles of microservices, service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance, and can design and implement scalable and resilient distributed systems.

If you're interested in seeing my solutions using microservice architecture or have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me at [karanimartin17@gmail.com](mailto:karanimartin17@gmail.com).

Thank you for considering me for the internship opportunity!
